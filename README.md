# Image-Animation-for-Mentally-Weak-Students
This is a project for mentally disabled students who do not have much interest in the classes taken by teachers
A real time facial puppetry system is presented.Compared with existing systems, the proposed method requiresno special hardware, runs in real time (23 frames-per-second),and requires only a single image of the avatar and user. Theuser’s facial expression is captured through a real-time 3D non-rigid tracking system. Expression transfer is achieved by com-bining a generic expression model with synthetically generatedexamples that better capture person speciﬁc characteristics.Performance of the system is evaluated on avatars of real peopleas well as masks and cartoon characters.
Image animation is the technology that transfers the motion posture of an object in a
driving video to the static object in the source frame. Given a source image and a driving
video depicting the same object type, the goal of image animation is to generate a video
by learning the motion from the driving video while preserving the appearance from the
source image. As shown in Figure 1, the motion from the driving videos in the second
row is transferred to the source images in the first row. In the animated videos in the third
row, the objects from the source images follow the exact same motion as the driving videos.
Nowadays, image animation has achieved extensive application in film production, virtual
reality, photography and electronic commerce.
